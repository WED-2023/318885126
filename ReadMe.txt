Overview
This project is a tribute website dedicated to Carl Fredricksen, the main character of the animated movie "Up" by Pixar. The website features multiple sections, each offering different types of content related to Carl and the movie "Up". The site is designed to be interactive and engaging, with features like a slideshow, a playlist, a balloon counter, and various ways to share and interact with the content.

Special Features
1. Animated Balloons Counter:
* Users can click a button to "fly" a balloon in memory of Carl. Each click increases the balloon count, which is stored in the browser's local storage to persist across sessions.
* The counter updates dynamically, and the balloons float up the screen with a smooth animation.
2. Slideshow with Social Sharing:
* The photos section includes a slideshow of images from the movie. Each slide has social media share buttons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) that update dynamically based on the currently displayed image.
3. Media Playlist:
* A playlist section features both audio tracks and a video related to the movie "Up".
4. Interactive Contact Form:
* The form submission is handled using a mailto link, which opens the user's default email client pre-filled with the message content.

File Structure
* index.html: Main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
* style.css: CSS file for styling the website.
* pictures/: Directory containing all image files used in the website.
* audio/: Directory containing audio files for the playlist.
* videos/: Directory containing video files for the playlist (if any).
